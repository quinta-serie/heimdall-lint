# Contributing
Before you start contributing to the project, read with careful and patience our git working model, code review and coding style.

## Git working model
- Create a branch to develop your feature/fix from the ```main``` branch.
- We recommend to use the ```Semantic Commit Messages``` for your commits and branch's name ([see more](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716)).
- After completing the development, do a pull request.

## Code Review
- Pull Requests are mandatory to merge into ```main```.
- Every PR must have a reviewer other than the owner.
